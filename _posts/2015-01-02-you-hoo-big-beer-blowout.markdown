I’m going to start this post of with an apology to anyone reading this. I’m an incompetent writer who struggles to punctuate a sentence, heaven knows how I got a C in english. Anyway I digress let’s get back to the main point of this blog. I have made a new years resolution to try more real ales and artisanal beers. Therefore this year I aim to drink one or two new beers every week from around the UK.

I was introduced to real ales by a colleague at my first job who ran the local beer festival he’s still a bit miffed that every year I shun this recommendations for foreign fruit beers such as Fruli etc. Most of the beers I will review this year will be light and/or fruity beers (just like myself) terrible pun sorry about that.

Lets get started with the actual beer review:

I brought in the new year with 4 beers, what follows is my attempt at reviewing them. I don’t know any of the terminology / lingo and my mind is a little fuzzy from that night sorry :(.

## Badgers – Golden Champion **(4 – 5)**
Really nice beer didn’t leave too much of a bitter taste in the mouth. According to the tasting notes on the brewers website I should have tasted floral and subtle tangerine notes. I’ll take their word on that one. Overall golden champion was a good all round beer perfect on a warm summers day and a barbecue.

## Tolly English Ale **(2 – 5)**
Not really a fan of this beer too bitter for me I really like simple easy to drink beers. Tolly wasn’t a pleasure to drink at all. Of all the drinks that night this one took me the longest to finish that was with giving half away and downing the last little bit to get it over with. Again I was supposed to “taste tropical notes” again I didn’t, I’m starting to think my taste buds don’t work as they should.

## Fullers Hondeydew **(3.5 – 5)**
Nice beer a little bitter and considering it’s got honey on the bottle not that sweet all that being said I wouldn’t have turned another one down. I might have to try another without having the Tolly English ale before it, If i do this beers score might go up.

(After re-reading this review and having 1 line of text it struck me fullers honeydew wasn’t a very memorable beer middle of the road)

## Greene and King – IPA Gold **(5 – 5)**
Full marks and top of the class for this beer I could have sat and drank bottle after bottle of this beer without too much trouble the only stumbling block being I only bought one and the shops were closed when I got round to this one. On a positive note the bottle said i should taste tropical notes and I actually tasted something the beer advertised, guess my taste buds aren’t knackered after all.
