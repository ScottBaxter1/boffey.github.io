About this time Last year I planned to drink a new real ale / beer / lager every week and document my experiences online. But Let's face it last years attempt, turned out to be a flash in the pan. I don't think you can even call it that, doing so would be an insult to both flashes and pans. Anyhow this coming year I plan to do much better. That being said the most probable outcome is failing again at the first hurdle.

That's the excuses out of the way lets get a couple of updates out of the way. 

# Projects

As part of my job I have to learn how to learn a lot of new technologies. To achieve this I tend to make personal projects, these are small projects with no real marketable purpose. They tend to be useful only to me as the two examples below is demonstrate. 

## Eurovision Alerter

This was an experiment in web scraping content. The Eurovision Song Contest is one of my favourite things i look forward to every year. I've been planning on attending for a couple of years now only to find out too late that tickets have sold out. 

This year with the contest being held in Stockholm, Sweden (Where I wish I lived) I knew I had to finally get there. Todo this I wrote a script to parse the website for all news and email me a round updates every 30 mins. the project has been a success as I'm the proud owner of two tickets to the Eurovision final _NERD ALERT_.

## Christmas

Recently I've been experimenting with front end JS frameworks to help me improve the maintainability and functionality of my content management system I manage for clients. Again small project to the rescue. I created a small website where you login using a Facebook account and can simply check off which Christmas movies you've seen this holiday period.

The reason I do these small projects and not follow a tutorial or video courses is for one main reason. To try and get to used to working with something in less than ideal situations. For instance a lot for tutorials will gloss over features they deem to difficult to implement, They tend not to include mistakes how to investigate a problem. So when something does break you have no idea on how you got to this point, how to start finding the problem and proclaim **THIS IS F\*\*CKING STUPID** and throw everything in the Bin. I try to use my own projects so I feel as though I've accomplished something and I'm kept interested in the outcome.

Well I've droned on and bored you enough for one day, I'll sign off now and hope you enjoy the content to come.
