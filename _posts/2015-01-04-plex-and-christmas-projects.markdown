## My Plex Setup

This christmas I set myself a little project to build a media server and get it all up and running before the end of the break.

I’ve previously attempted to do this and failed, I just ended up putting all the movies into a folder on a NAS and struggled like buggery trying to find a film to watch. Another downside to this already idiotic idea was the inability to stream films to devices such as iPads, iPhones and Apple TVs

This time I needed to do it properly after watching a couple of videos and reading around on the web I came across Plex Media Server.

# Setup

Initial I had planned on installing plex onto the Drobo as an app. This would have been ideal unfortunately this was not 
to be as I appear to have a older version of the drobo FS. luckily I found buried under a pile of paper and assorted rubbish a very old samsung netbook. I installed a spare copy of windows 8.1. I was very surprised to see that windows 8.1 ran really well on the machine, a little slow but i’ve seen much worse on much better machines. (here’s looking at you vista)

After installing plex and mounting the drobo network drive. I then began the arduous task of renaming all the content according to the plex documentation. Fast forward a couple of days and late nights. I’d managed to rename all the content, only to be hit with another problem. I was unable to play any itunes movies. I need to remove the DRM from them luckily I found an excellent programme Tunes Kit for Mac to remove the copy protection.

So here we are at the end of a long weekend / christmas break project with a very nice and seemingly reliable media server which works with pretty much every device I know. This project has opened my eyes to a few of things

- The number of films a family can collect
- Finding films I cannot remember watching or even purchasing
- Just how much money I have given to Apple for iTunes Content
