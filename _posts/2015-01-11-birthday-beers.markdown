Time for week 2 of the big beer review 2015. I was meant to be cutting down the number of beers this week but Its my birthday so balls to it lets have another bumper week.

## Lancaster Blonde **(3 – 5)**

Overall a nice beer, a little on the bitter side for my liking. The beer definitely got better towards the end of the drink as my taste buds got more accustomed to the bitterness. According to the website this beer should have had a delicate biscuit overtone. I’m not really sure what a biscuity overtone should taste like, i’ll again have to take the brewers word on that one.

## Bishops Finger **(2 – 5)**

I should have know this beer was not for me given the dark colour of the liquid inside however i couldn’t resist buying a bottle with bishops finger plastered on the front (I’m still about 11 years old at heart). My experience with this beer can be summed up in one simple world “YUK” far far too bitter was a chore to drink needing to motivate myself to take a sip.

## Old Golden Hen **(4 – 5)**

Back to my style of beer light and fruity. Much more of a pleasure to drink can’t say i’m surprised by this beer at all. It was a safe bet considering last week I indulged in a Greene and King IPA a beer of similar colour and taste to my palate. It would appear I’m quickly becoming a Greene and King fan boy. The only thing that stopped this beer being favorite of the week was the Doom Bar.

## Sharps Doom Bar  **(4.5 – 5)**

I was very apprehensive about this beer from looking at the colour. I fretted that I was in for another Bishops Finger a beer i couldn’t stand but drinking it anyway as I’d paid for the bottle. My goodness I was in for a massive surprise not only did this beer prove really drinkable it almost surpassed the famed IPA for top stop in the leaderboard (which i still haven’t made yet).
